Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Budget Tracker
Making Money

Description Challenge this week is to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. Once you’ve made these changes, you’ll deploy the application to Heroku.
